# Adobe_Bridge_Show_Geo_Location

Adobe Bridge CC startup-script.

Adds an option to photo context menus in Adobe Bridge CC, to see the photo's geo-position on Google Maps.
Current version shows position on Google Maps using Firefox webbrowser (I wasn't able to get script working specifying only URI in cmd, but giving URI via my webbrowser worked).

You might want/need to experiment with how cmd is defined, including maybe adjusting path to your webbrowser's location.

To install, copy the jsx file into Adobe Bridge's Startup Scripts folder. To find this folder's location, open Adobe Bridge and choose: Preferences -> Startup Scripts -> Reveal My Startup Scripts.

Tested in Adobe Bridge v8.1 on Windows 10.
