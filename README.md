# Adobe_Bridge_Show_Geo_Location

Adobe Photoshop Bridge CC "plugin" to make it possible to see geolocation of photos from Bridge.

Adds an option to photo context menus in Adobe Bridge CC, to see the photo's geo-position on Google Maps
(Will open in the default webbrowser).

You _might_ want/need to experiment with how _cmd_ is defined in the code. Mac users should change line #39 to something like:

`var cmd = "open \"https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=" + latResult + "," + lonResult + "\"";`

To install, simply copy [the jsx file](https://github.com/StigNygaard/Adobe_Bridge_Show_Geo_Location/raw/master/ShowOnGoogleMaps.jsx)
into Adobe Bridge's _Startup Scripts_ folder. To find this folder's location, open Bridge and choose:
Preferences -> Startup Scripts -> Reveal My Startup Scripts.

Verified working on Windows 10/11 with Adobe Bridge from CC 2018 (vers. 8) to CC 2023 (vers. 13).

I don't really have any knowledge or prior experience on scripting in Adobe CC, but inspired by an
[older script by Paul-Riggott](https://github.com/Paul-Riggott/PS-Scripts/blob/master/Map%20from%20Geotag.jsx)
(which ain't working in newer CC versions) and a [discussion in Photoshop Family support](https://feedback.photoshop.com/photoshop_family/topics/_mapping_the_photo_in_bridge),
I have been able to create this. Also thanks to [Gene Parcellano](https://github.com/geneparcellano) for above-mentioned
modification for Mac users.
